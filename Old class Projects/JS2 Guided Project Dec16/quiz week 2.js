//Anonymous functions in JavaScript are functions that do not have a name associated with them 
//1. They are defined using the function keyword without a function name 
//1. Anonymous functions are commonly used as callbacks in JavaScript 
//1. They can be passed as arguments to other functions and invoked later 
//1. Anonymous functions can also be invoked immediately after their creation, which is known as a self-executing function 1.

//Therefore, the correct answer is: They are commonly used as callbacks 1.

//In JavaScript, `call` and `apply` are two methods that allow you to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments Â¹Â²Â³. The main difference between the two is in how they accept arguments.

//The `call` method accepts an argument list, where each argument is passed separately Â¹Â²Â³. For example, if you have a function `func` that takes three arguments, you can call it using `call` as follows: `func.call(thisValue, arg1, arg2, arg3)` Â¹Â²Â³.

//On the other hand, the `apply` method accepts an array of arguments Â¹Â²Â³. For example, if you have a function `func` that takes three arguments, you can call it using `apply` as follows: `func.apply(thisValue, [arg1, arg2, arg3])` Â¹Â²Â³.

//In terms of performance, `call` is generally faster than `apply` when passing a small number of arguments Â¹Â²Â³. However, when passing a large number of arguments, `apply` can be faster than `call` Â¹Â²Â³.

//I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
